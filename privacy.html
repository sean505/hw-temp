						<h1><strong>Hootsworth&trade; Privacy Policy</strong></h1>
						<ol>
						<li style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px; padding: 20px 0;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introduction</span></li>
						
						<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Privacy Policy applies to your use of Hootsworth&trade;, a service of Emtrain. Emtrain values the privacy of users who visit and use the Hootsworth Services (collectively or individually, &ldquo;</span><strong>you</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo; or &ldquo;</span><strong>users</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;) and wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use, and disclose personal information from and about you (&ldquo;</span><strong>Personal Information</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;).</span></p>
						<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may share Personal Information when using the Hootsworth Services. One example is when you provide information about yourself as part of the Hootsworth account creation process. Another is when you take certain actions on the Hootsworth site, such as when you search the site, visit web pages on the site, or submit questions through the site.</span></p>
						<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By agreeing to this Privacy Policy in your Hootsworth account setup, or by using the Hootsworth Services, you expressly consent to the information handling practices described in this Privacy Policy. </span></p>
						<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We understand that you care about your own personal privacy, and we take that seriously. This Privacy Statement describes Emtrain&rsquo;s policies and practices regarding its collection and use of your personal data. We recognize that information privacy is an ongoing responsibility, and so we will from time to time update this Privacy Policy as we undertake new personal data practices or adopt new privacy policies. </span></p>
						<li style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px; padding: 20px 0;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personal Information We Collect</span></li>
						
						<p><strong>User-provided Information</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: You may provide a variety of information about yourself to us, such as your name, work email address, and the name of your employer when you register or otherwise use the features and functionality of the Hootsworth Services. You must keep your password strictly confidential. You are responsible for all actions taken using your account information and password, and you agree to immediately notify Emtrain of any unauthorized use of which you become aware.</span></p>
						<p><strong>Workplace Conduct Questions. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may also submit questions through the Hootsworth site about workplace conduct issues. One feature of the Hootsworth Services is publishing those questions&mdash;after removing details that Emtrain believes are likely to identify the companies and individuals referenced in the questions&mdash;along with answers to the questions, to provide guidance to all users of the Hootsworth Services.</span></p>
						<p><strong>Automatically Collected Information</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The Hootsworth website collects certain information automatically and stores it in log files. The information may include Internet Protocol address (&ldquo;</span><strong>IP</strong> <strong>Address</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;), the region or general location where your computer or device is accessing the internet, device and browser types and identifiers, operating system a unique user ID, referring and exit page addresses, software and system type, and information about your usage of the Hootsworth Services, including a history of the pages you view. </span></p>
						<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use this information to help us design our site to better suit our users&rsquo; needs. We may also use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website, analyze trends, track visitor movements, and gather broad demographic information that assists us in identifying visitor preferences. The Hootsworth website also uses cookies and web beacons. It does not track users when they cross to third party websites, does not provide targeted advertising to them, and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals.</span></p>
						<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Examples of how Emtrain uses automatically collected information include to: (a) remember your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you access the Hootsworth Services; (b) provide customized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of marketing campaigns; (d) monitor and store aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages accessed; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities.</span></p>
						<p><strong>Information from Other Sources</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: We will not obtain information about you from third parties, such as advertisers or social media networks. </span></p>
						
						<li style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px; padding: 20px 0;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cookies</span></li>
						
						<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our web pages may use &ldquo;cookies,&rdquo; which are text files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer&rsquo;s hard drive through your Web browser that enable the site&rsquo;s or service provider&rsquo;s systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.</span></p>
						<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, we use cookies to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. For example, we may use Cookies to personalize your experience using the Hootsworth Services. </span></p>
						<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cookies alone do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering with Hootsworth. However, once you choose to furnish Hootsworth with personally identifiable information, that information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. You can choose not to receive a cookie file by directing your Web browser to refuse Cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie. </span></p>
						
						<li style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px; padding: 20px 0;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How We Use Personal Information</span></li>
						
						<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emtrain uses Personal Information to operate, maintain, enhance, provide, create, and develop the features, functionality, and services (new or existing) found on the Hootsworth Services; improve your experience with the Hootsworth Services by delivering content that we hope you will find relevant and interesting; and understand the usage trends of our users.</span></p>
						<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emtrain may also use Personal Information, and share such information with contracted third parties that perform functions on Emtrain&rsquo;s behalf and under Emtrain&rsquo;s instruction, to perform analytics and assist with customer support, account management, and our marketing efforts. </span></p>
						<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emtrain will not disclose Personal Information to your employer, </span><strong>but</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we may inform the company you identify as your employer that one or more of its unidentified employees have indicated interest in topics addressed in the Hootsworth Services as part of our marketing efforts.</span></p>
						<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use your company email address to communicate with you, including to notify you of major Hootsworth Services updates, for customer service purposes, or to contact you regarding any content that you have posted to or downloaded from the Hootsworth Services.</span></p>
						
						<li style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px; padding: 20px 0;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choice</span></li>
						
						<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may decline to share certain information with Emtrain, in which case Emtrain may not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionality found on the Hootsworth Services. If you have created a Hootsworth Services account, then you can update your profile information and preferences or disable your account by logging in and going to the &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; page. If you close your account, Emtrain may retain other information about you for the activities described in this Privacy Policy, or as permitted or required by applicable law.</span></p>
						<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To protect your privacy and security, we may take steps to verify your identity before granting you access or making corrections to your information. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your password and account information.</span></p>
						
						<li style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px; padding: 20px 0;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Protection and Security</span></li>
						
						<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emtrain uses a variety of managerial, technical, and physical measures to protect the integrity and security of your information. These measures may vary based on the sensitivity of your information. However, no security precautions or systems can be completely secure. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Emtrain, and you do so at your own risk. We cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</span></p>
						
						<li style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px; padding: 20px 0;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Non-Personal / Aggregated Data</span></li>
						
						<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to any Personal Information you may voluntarily provide to us, the Hootsworth Services also collect general information regarding visitors and users as it relates to their use of the Hootsworth Services (&ldquo;</span><strong>Aggregated Data</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;). This information is collected automatically each time a user navigates the Hootsworth website. The term Aggregated Data includes such information as traffic patterns, number, frequency and duration of visits to certain pages, visits from other web sites or to third-party web sites linked to the Hootsworth website, use of particular services and interest in services, information or features of the Hootsworth Services made available through or found through the Hootsworth Services. This information is anonymous and is useful for improving the content and navigational tools of our web site. Aggregated Data may also include information or data obtained from you or other sources which has been combined with or compiled from other information or data in such a manner to no longer be personally identifiable or linked to an individual. Aggregated Data is not considered Personal Information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy. </span></p>
						
						<li style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px; padding: 20px 0;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When We Disclose and Share Information</span></li>
						
						<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emtrain does not share information that can identify you personally with third parties for their marketing or promotional uses without your consent. We may share such information for the following purposes:</span></p>
						<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may disclose such information to service providers working on our behalf, such as, to: provide website hosting, maintenance, and security services; conduct data analysis and create reports; offer certain functionality; or assist Emtrain in improving the Hootsworth Services and creating new services and features. We require that these parties process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy, we authorize them to use the information only for the purposes for which it is provided to them, and we require them to use reasonable confidentiality measures.</span></p>
						<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emtrain may disclose your Personal Information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to comply with U.S. state and federal laws or other applicable laws around the world (for example, in the country of your residence), or respond to a court order, judicial or other government request, subpoena, or warrant in the manner legally required.</span></p>
						<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emtrain also reserves the right to disclose Personal Information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to protect Emtrain from potential liability or from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; investigate and defend ourselves against third-party claims, or allegations; protect the security or integrity of the Hootsworth Services; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Emtrain, our users, or others.</span></p>
						<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personal Information.</span></p>
						
						<li style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px; padding: 20px 0;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third Party Services and Websites</span></li>
						
						<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hootsworth Services may link to third-party websites or services. The privacy practices of those third parties are not governed by this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party websites and services to understand their practices.</span></p>
						
						<li style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px; padding: 20px 0;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">California Privacy Rights</span></li>
						
						<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California law permits users who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of the third parties to whom we have disclosed their personal information (if any) for their direct marketing purposes in the prior calendar year, as well as the type of personal information disclosed to those parties. Emtrain does not currently disclose personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.</span></p>
						
						<li style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px; padding: 20px 0;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do Not Track</span></li>
						
						<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do Not Track (&ldquo;</span><strong>DNT</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third-party purposes, but we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT. It&rsquo;s also important to note that we do not allow third party behavioral tracking.</span></p>
						
						<li style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px; padding: 20px 0;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other People&rsquo;s Personal Information </span></li>
						
						<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should obtain the consent of any third party prior to your providing any personal information of that third party through the Hootsworth Services, as any access to view or change his/her information may be available only through your account.</span></p>
						
						<li style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px; padding: 20px 0;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Children&rsquo;s Privacy</span></li>
						
						<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, THEN PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE HOOTSWORTH SERVICES AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER.</span></p>
						<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Emtrain does not knowingly collect or maintain personal information from persons under 13 years of age. If Emtrain learns that personal information of persons under 13 years of age has been collected on or through the Hootsworth Services, Emtrain will take appropriate steps to delete this information.</span></p>
						<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has become a Hootsworth Services member, then please contact Emtrain at </span><a href="mailto:support@emtrain.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">support@emtrain.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to have that child&rsquo;s account terminated and personal information deleted.</span></p>
						
						<li style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px; padding: 20px 0;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy</span></li>
						
						<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emtrain reserves the right to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at any time (for example to reflect updates to the Hootsworth Services or to reflect changes in the law). If Emtrain changes this Privacy Policy, we will provide you notice of these changes, such as by sending an email, posting a notice on the Hootsworth Services, or updating the &ldquo;Last Updated&rdquo; date above. Please check this Privacy Policy periodically for those changes. Your continued use of the Hootsworth Services after the posting of changes constitutes your binding acceptance of such changes.</span></p>
						
						<li style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px; padding: 20px 0;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merger or Sale</span></li>
						
						<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Emtrain, or some or all assets related to the Hootsworth Services are acquired by or merged with a third-party entity or because of a contemplated change of ownership transaction, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from users as part of that merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control event.</span></p>
						
						<li style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px; padding: 20px 0;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contact Information </span></li>
